#### This mod is not complete, and may not install properly.

### Warnings

This mod installs and sets up lxc (and related scripts and tools, etc) onto a mail-in-a-box system. This is not an official modification, and should not be used. If you still want to use it feel free, it is here more for education.
This mod can cause some compatibility issues with MIAB, upgrading MIAB, etc. Use at your own risk.

### What this mod does

This mod will allow you to create containers (Think Virtual Machine) in the MIAB Admin Dashboard.

### Whats required to run this mod

Mail-In-A-Box NEEDS to be installed first before this mod. this mod follows all the same requirements MIAB has:

- Running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
